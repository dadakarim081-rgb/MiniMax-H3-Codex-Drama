# ComfyUI runtime procedure

The companion MCP is pinned in the plugin to `artokun/comfyui-mcp` 0.49.3. It may expose either direct tools or compact meta-tools. When only `list_tools`, `describe_tool`, and `call_tool` are visible, discover and invoke the named operation through those meta-tools.

## 1. Resolve the request and configuration

Layer configuration in this order; later non-empty values win:

1. Built-in defaults.
2. User config: `~/.config/minimax-h3-comfyui/comfy-config.json`.
3. Project config: `<project-root>/.config/comfy-config.json`.
4. Explicit request flags and settings.

The built-in address is `localhost:8188`; normalize a bare host and port to `http://localhost:8188`. Empty strings and `null` preserve workflow defaults. See `assets/comfy-config.example.json` and `references/comfy-config.schema.json`.

Before connecting, writing a prepared graph, or uploading media, strip bracket controls, extract only unambiguous natural-language name/value execution settings, select the mode and effective variant, and validate the request-derived settings. Remove extracted setting clauses from the model prompt, but preserve ambiguous wording instead of inventing a value. Turbo permits only its custom sampler, the `simple` scheduler, and 4–8 steps. On an invalid value, stop without side effects and report the allowed value or the `[turbo=false]` opt-out; never clamp a value or switch variants silently.

## 2. Test reachability

Use `scripts/inspect_instance.py --mode <t2v|i2v|r2v|audio> --project-root <project-root>` or the MCP `get_system_stats` operation to test reachability. The inspector follows the configured Turbo default; pass `--turbo` or `--no-turbo` when the request overrides it. If the default is reachable, continue without asking about configuration. If unreachable, warn once and offer only two choices: retry or update the applicable config address. Do not create a config file unless the user chooses to update it.

The bundled MCP entry targets `http://localhost:8188`. When a non-default address is configured, the MCP client's `COMFYUI_URL` must target that same normalized address; report a mismatch instead of sending work to the wrong server.

## 3. Resolve nodes and models conservatively

Required model roles are:

- T2V/I2V/audio diffusion: `fl2va`
- R2V diffusion: `ref2va`
- all modes: `text_encoder`, `video_vae`, and `audio_vae`
- Turbo modes: `turbo_lora`, defaulting to `minimax_h3_turbo_v4_step600_ema.safetensors`

Turbo also requires the `MiniMaxH3TurboLoRA` and `MiniMaxH3TurboSampler` node classes from [ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo](https://github.com/Larryvrh/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo). Check both classes before media upload or enqueue. If either is absent, report the missing dependency and stop. With explicit permission, the user can install **MiniMax-H3 Turbo** through ComfyUI-Manager or clone the node pack under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`, then restart ComfyUI. Put the [Turbo LoRA](https://huggingface.co/larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora) in `ComfyUI/models/loras/`. Do not perform any of those state changes silently.

Use `list_local_models` and verbose `get_node_info` for `UNETLoader`, `CLIPLoader`, `VAELoader`, and `MiniMaxH3TurboLoRA`, or use `scripts/inspect_instance.py`. Resolve each role in this order:

1. Explicit user choice.
2. Non-empty config choice.
3. Pinned official filename, when installed.
4. Exactly one installed filename compatible by role.
5. Ask the user when multiple compatible candidates remain.
6. Report the missing role when none exist.

Do not substitute an FL2VA model for REF2VA or vice versa. For Turbo, preserve LoRA strength `1.0` and low-VRAM mode off; the latter is the sharper upstream default. Use only 4–8 steps with the `simple` scheduler, with 6 steps as the bundled default. Do not download models, install nodes, restart ComfyUI, or change the user's installation without explicit permission.

## 4. Upload media

Inspect chat attachments before routing. Resolve each local attachment to an absolute path, then use:

- `upload_image` for I2V frames and R2V images
- `upload_video` for R2V videos
- `upload_audio` for R2V standalone audio

Use the returned ComfyUI filename in the preparer. I2V requires a first frame and accepts one optional last frame. R2V accepts at most 9 images, 3 videos, and 3 standalone audio files. The preparer connects a reference video's frames and its paired audio from `GetVideoComponents`.

Audio mode uploads no media. It is prompt-only and keeps its disposable visual latent fixed at 32x32. If a reference must control voice or sound, route to R2V instead.

Never guess the remote input directory or insert the chat attachment's local path into `LoadImage`, `LoadVideo`, or `LoadAudio`.

## 5. Prepare and validate

Create the patched graph in a temporary directory or a user-requested output location:

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/prepare_workflow.py \
  --mode t2v \
  --project-root <project-root> \
  --prompt-file <prompt.txt> \
  --output <temporary-workflow.json>
```

Turbo is selected by default. Pass `--no-turbo` only when `[turbo=false]` (or another false alias) wins; pass `--turbo` when an explicit true flag must override a false config value. Pass uploaded filenames with `--first-frame`, `--last-frame`, repeated `--reference-image`, repeated `--reference-video`, or repeated `--reference-audio`. Pass resolved filenames with `--fl2va`, `--ref2va`, `--text-encoder`, `--video-vae`, `--audio-vae`, and `--turbo-lora` when applicable.

For audio-only work, pass `--mode audio`; do not pass width, height, or media flags. The preparer selects the audio API/UI pair, fixes 32x32 internally, removes video output, and targets core `SaveAudio`.

Use `validate_workflow` on the resulting API graph. If it reports missing models, re-run the resolution procedure. If it reports a missing core H3 node, report that the connected ComfyUI version lacks MiniMax H3 support. If it reports either Turbo node missing, report the node-pack setup above and suggest `[turbo=false]` only as an explicit user choice. Do not enqueue until validation has no errors.

## 6. Load or preview the workflow

Treat `[load_workflow=false]` as a fully headless run. Do not initialize or open a browser, do not inspect browser state, and do not mention preview or canvas behavior in progress updates. Ignore `[preview]` while workflow loading is disabled.

Only handle browser preview when `[load_workflow=true]` is explicit. Warn that unsaved canvas changes may be replaced, then use an available live-canvas operation to load the matching prepared UI workflow. When preview is enabled and the Codex Desktop in-app browser is available, open the normalized address after loading; use picture-in-picture presentation when supported, otherwise use a normal in-app browser view. Outside Codex Desktop, return the URL instead of treating preview as an error.

When workflow loading is enabled but only headless tools exist, save a uniquely named UI copy with `save_workflow` and use the browser to open it; do not overwrite an existing saved workflow. When preview is explicitly disabled, keep any required browser work in the background and do not present the browser to the user.

## 7. Submit and wait

Call `enqueue_workflow` exactly once and retain its `prompt_id`.

For `[return=false]`, stop after successful submission and return the `prompt_id`. Do not wait, poll, fetch, or infer future success. If the user later asks about that ID, use `get_history`; on failure use `diagnose_run` and then `get_logs` only if needed.

For the default `[return=true]`, monitor the exact ID using execution events, queue status, and `get_history`. The wait ceiling is the configured value, capped at 60 minutes. Keep the user updated during long runs and do not perform a single blocking wait longer than 60 seconds. On timeout, leave the job running and return the `prompt_id`.

Prefer ComfyUI's live terminal-log stream over repeated fixed-interval queue polls. The web UI's **LOGS** panel displays the same stream. Use an available MCP log subscription or raw-log operation first. On a standalone ComfyUI server when no matching tool exists, the frontend reads the backlog from `GET /internal/logs/raw`, enables live delivery with `PATCH /internal/logs/subscribe` using `{ "enabled": true, "clientId": "<client-id>" }`, and receives `logs` events on `/ws?clientId=<client-id>`. Do not hard-code these standalone routes for cloud deployments.

Parse the most recent tqdm sampler line after initialization. A representative line is:

```text
50%|█████████████████████████████| 3/6 [09:59<09:59, 199.80s/it]
```

Treat the value after `<` as the sampler ETA and the `3/6` pair as current sampler progress. At `0%` with `Model Initializing`, no reliable ETA exists yet. Prefer a persistent log subscription so progress and failure events wake the monitor without polling. If only log snapshots are available, wait adaptively from the parsed ETA, capped at 55 seconds per wait, then read one fresh progress slice. Fall back to queue status and `get_history` when logs are unavailable or no ETA is parseable.

Raw terminal lines do not necessarily include a `prompt_id`. Use their ETA only when queue or execution state confirms that the retained ID is the active sampler job and the association is unambiguous. With parallel active jobs, ignore unscoped log ETAs and use per-prompt progress and history events instead.

The tqdm ETA covers the sampler phase, not video/audio VAE decoding or file saving. When the sampler reaches `100%` or `<00:00`, continue waiting for `execution_success` and confirm the exact history entry or fresh output before reporting completion.

On a failed or rejected run:

1. Call `diagnose_run` with the exact `prompt_id` when one exists.
2. Check `get_history` for the recorded traceback and node.
3. Use diagnostic log context beyond the already-read sampler progress slice only when needed.
4. Correct a deterministic filename or graph patch only when the intended choice is unambiguous; otherwise ask.

Never enqueue a second attempt silently.

## 8. Fetch results

Read the exact history entry. For video modes, if `SaveVideo` does not register a media output, use `list_output_images` and match a fresh file by filename prefix and modification time. Fetch the video with `get_image`, setting `save_dir` to a temporary directory or a user-selected directory rather than the repository root.

For audio mode, read the `SaveAudio` output record from the exact history entry, fetch it through ComfyUI's `/view` endpoint or matching media tool, and save it to a temporary or user-selected directory. Verify that the FLAC decodes; for final claims also check duration and, when relevant, transcript and peak/clipping behavior.

In Codex Desktop, return the absolute local audio or video path in a rendered media link together with the `prompt_id`. Outside Codex Desktop, return the saved absolute path and ComfyUI output reference.
